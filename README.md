Depression and anxiety have been on the rise over the past few years, and
software engineer Yoni Levine has been applying Natural Language Processing and
Machine Learning algorithms on forums dedicated to supporting suicidal and
depressed people. By analyzing the data scraped from these algorithms, Levine
was able to find common words that indicated a shift from depressed to suicidal
tendencies. Some of these words included "hate", "cutting", and "pain".

It is heartbreaking to see that a larger percentage of the population are more depressed than their younger 
counterparts. Through machine learning and natural language processing, it is admirable to attempt to prevent
those who will be more likely to commit suicide. Hopefully predictions used here can be helpful in supporting
medical professionals when diagnosing their patients.

This is a sad issue to think about, but the field of machine learning does have a use here. I'm interested to see
the broader applications of ML within the field of medicine, and how false-positives will become a fundamental issue.
